- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Andersonferr2020
I have a degree in industrial automation.
I took a master's degree in biomedical engineering but unfortunately, I wasn't able to complete the course (I had to work full time). 
Even so, it was an incredible experience and a great learning experience.
I'm very interested in learning how to develop solutions for the industry through virtualization and integration of machine information in real time. 
I have knowledge in Industrial Robotics, PLC programming and CNC Machines. 
I like to study, ride my bike and watch movies. 
I'm from Brazil.
